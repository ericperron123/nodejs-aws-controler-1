To run this project, you will need an AWS Developer account. 

1) Create a new IAM user through the console
  
  a) Open AWS Console > IAM > users > Add User
  b) choose a name such as “global-cli-user”
  c) Give it programmatic access
  d) You can choose the user groups to which your user belongs. For instance, 
     Developer’s group
     Administrators
     
     * If the group does not exist you will need to create the group after you have created the user 
       and assign the user to that group.
  
  WARNING: Once the account has been created, you will be provided with an Access key ID and a 
  secret access key. Keep these for your records and do not share with anyone. You will not get 
  access to the secret access key again. 

2) Download and install the CLI Client from AWS 
   
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html#cliv2-windows-Install

   verify that install was successful by running the following command
   
   > aws --version

3) Configure the AWS CLI client. This needs to be done once.

   run the following command: 

   > aws --configure

   Here are sample values: 

     Access key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
     Secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
     default region name: ca-central-1 
     Default output format: ENTER

   Congratulation. You are now connected!
