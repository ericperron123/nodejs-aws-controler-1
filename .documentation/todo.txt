Build 1 should do this; 

1)	Deploy an environment with VPC, Subnets, Database, Lambda function, S3 bucket
2)	Call the lambda function that will receive an image, save the meta data to the database and save the file to the S3 bucket. 
3)	Call another lambda function that returns an image and its meta data. 
4)	Undeploy the environment. 




1) Build an environment from which an on premise application can call a database and run operations on it. 
   a) set up vpc
   b) set up subnets
   c) set up secret manager
   d) set up a database. 
   e) Client app should be able to call that database from a on premise. 

2) Build a similar environment with the addition of a Lambda function editing the database

3) Build a similar environment with the addition of a EC2 load balanced server making changes to the database. 

4) review environments above and see how I can manage them with CloudFormation
