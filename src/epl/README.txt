ABOUT EPL (Eric Perron Library)
-----------------------------------

Throughout the years (since 1999), I have been using JavaScript in various projects. Though this package is in
typescript, it is based on a library that I carried from one project to the next.

While this package is useful, quite honestly, it is not extra-ordinary. Hence, it is not protected.
You can use this package where ever and whenever you want, as long as you keep this note in its root folder
and perhaps even send me an email; you know... to say thanks! or "Good job Eric!".

-----------------------------------
BROWSER AND NodeJS Compatible!
-----------------------------------

All script within this package are expected to run on BOTH browser's Javascript Engine and NodeJS

Popular Javascript Engines are:
  - Chakra -> Microsoft Edge
  - V8 -> Chromium (Google Chrome)
  - SpiderMonkey -> Mozilla Firefox
  - JavaScript Core -> Apple Safari


------------------------------------
WHY?
------------------------------------

The awesomeness of this type of package is that it can be shared by both the server and the web client. Hence, it
provides the ability to define functions and data model on both the web server and web client simultaneously.

Other advantages are:
    - Reduces incompatible data between the client and server.
    - Logic (functions and classes) behave in the same way on both server and web client.
    - Reduce dev time as no conversion is needed between server and client.
